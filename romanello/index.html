<h2 id="matteo-romanello"><a href="">Matteo Romanello</a></h2>
<p>Canonical citations are the standard way of citing primary sources (i.e. the ancient texts) in Classics: the ability to read them, that is knowing what the various abbreviations–very often ambiguous and at times even cryptic–that normally appear in such citations stand for is part of the early training of any classicist. However, having an expert system to capture automatically these citations and their meaning is one of the aims of the project of which the research presented in this paper is part: this issue has been long known <span class="citation">(Crane, Seales, and Terras 2009, 26)</span> but only recently tackled and therefore not yet solved <span class="citation">(Romanello, Boschetti, and Crane 2009; Romanello 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Such a system has great potential both for scholars in Classics and for the study of Classics as a discipline: capturing the citations of ancient texts that are contained in journal articles, commentaries, monographs and other secondary sources, allows us, for example, to track over time how and how much such texts were studied, an essential piece of information for a data-driven study of the discipline and its evolution.</p>
<p>Another possible use of the system is to display related bibliographic references within a reading environment for ancient texts. The examples that are used in this paper are taken from work that has been done to provide the GapVis interface of the Hellespont project<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> with such a functionality (see Fig. 1). One of the goals of the project is to create an enhanced virtual reading environment for one specific section of Thucydides’ <em>Histories</em>, the so-called “Pentecontaetia” (Thuc. 1,89 to 1,118). The references that are displayed in the secondary literature view of the reading interface are mined automatically from JSTOR and are showed together with links to the full-text of the journal article as well as to the cited passage in the Perseus digital library <span class="citation">(Romanello and Thomas 2012)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="mining-citations-extraction-and-disambiguation">Mining Citations: Extraction and Disambiguation</h2>
<!--Before going into more details concerning the ontological modelling of canonical texts and citations, let us consider briefly how the extraction of such citations from texts is performed. -->

<p>Extracting citations means, in fact, performing two different tasks: firstly, capturing the strings that constitute the citation and secondly establishing the actual meaning of that citation or, in other words, determining to which specific section of which text is that citation referring to. In Natural Language Processing (NLP) jargon these two steps are called respectively Named Entity Recognition (or extraction) and Named Entity Disambiguation.</p>
<p>In fact, my approach to citation extraction (see Fig. 2, no. 1 and 2) is essentially based on state-of-the-art NER techniques with the only difference being what it takes to adapt these techniques to the new domain to which they are applied <span class="citation">(Romanello 2013)</span>. Instead of considering only the usual NEs–such as names of people, places and organizations–I treat as NEs the different components of a citation in addition to any mention of ancient authors and works occurring in the context that surrounds the citation itself. For this purpose four distinct entities were identified: <code>aauthor</code>, <code>awork</code>, <code>refauwork</code> and <code>refscope</code>.<!-- perhaps explain what they are? --> In its current definition, a citation is a relation between any two entities, where one is always the indication of the citation’s scope (i.e. <code>refscope</code>) and the other can be any of the other entities (i.e. <code>aauthor</code>, <code>awork</code> and <code>refauwork</code>).</p>
<h3 id="figure-2-diagram-showing-the-various-phases-of-mining-canonical-citations-from-texts.">Figure 2: Diagram showing the various phases of mining canonical citations from texts.</h3>
<img src="extraction_steps.png" width="90%" />
<p>Once captured, citations need to be disambiguated: this is done by assigning to each citation its corresponding CTS URN <span class="citation">(Smith and Blackwell 2012a)</span>. CTS URNs are a kind of identifiers that follow the Uniform Resource Name standard and were developed in the framework of the Multitext Homer project as part of the CITE architecture and were designed to become the equivalent of canonical citations in a digital environment, in the sense that they allow one to “identify and retrieve digital representations of texts” <span class="citation">(ref, Smith and Blackwell 2012b)</span><sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. What this means in practice is that the citation “Hell. 3.3.1-4” of the example showed in Fig. 1 (no. 3) is mapped to its corresponding URN, namely <code>urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:3.3.1-3.3.4</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-knowledge-base-of-canonical-texts">A Knowledge Base of Canonical Texts</h2>
<p>NER systems of this kind typically require/rely on a surrogate of domain knowledge, such as a gazetteer or a knowledge base, to support both the extraction and disambiguation of NEs, and even more so in the case of open domain applications. To support the disambiguation of canonical citations such a knowledge base needs to contain, for example, all possible abbreviations of the name of an author or the title of a work, possibly in multiple languages to work on multi-lingual corpora. Since the texts we are dealing with are canonical it is possible to store in this knowledge base, In addition to abbreviations, also detailed information about the citable structures of each text such as for example how many books are contained in Thucydides’ <em>Histories</em>, how many chapters are contained in book 1 etc. Being able to query this sort of information allows one to validate the automatically extracted citations, thus making possible to identify, if not to recover, those citations that are just <em>impossible</em>. An example of this phenomenon is the string “Thuc. 5. 14. 1. 41.”: although it looks as a plausible citation, it is not a valid one as the work here referred to–Thucydides’ <em>Histories</em>–is made of three, not four, citable, hierarchical levels, (i.e. book/chapter/section). Such errors are very common when working with OCRed texts where the lack of structural markup causes, as in this case, the footnote number to be mistakenly interpreted as being part of the canonical citation “Thuc. 5. 14. 1”.</p>

-->

<p>The content in the knowledge base is structured mostly using a combination of CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo ontologies<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>: the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model, in particular, is suitable for modelling information related to Classical (canonical) texts, as was showed by <span class="citation">Babeu et al. (2007, ref)</span>, and has influenced substantially the design of the CTS protocol. In those few cases where these ontologies did not suffice to model the data we have extended some of the classes they provide in what we called the HUmanities CITation Ontology (HuCit)<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-extracted-citations">Publishing Extracted Citations</h2>
<p>Not only are canonical citations important because of their function, they are also interesting artifacts in themselves. They were designed, well before the advent of digital technologies, to refer to texts in a very precise and interoperable way: <em>precise</em> because texts are the fundamental object of philological research, therefore a scholarly discourse about texts needs a very accurate way of referring to them; <em>interoperable</em> because although texts may exist in different editions and translations, scholars need to be able to refer to specific sections of them without having to worry about the many possible variations in pagination or layout each single edition may present.</p>
<p>If we accept that canonical citations are already a way of linking objects–namely the citing and the cited texts–extracting them means then to reconstruct and make explicit such links that already exist, in some form, in the text. The act of transforming citations into hyperlinks, however, may lead to a misrepresentation of their nature and specifically of their being designed to be interoperable: a canonical citation should not be tight to the referred passage in a specific edition, but should rather work as a resolvable pointer, that can be resolved to a given portion of text in any (available) edition or translation.</p>
<p>Let us now look at an example of how the extracted citations are being stored and published online as Linked Open Data <span class="citation">(Heath and Bizer 2011)</span>. By following an approach that was largely inspired by the Pelagios Project<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>, extracted canonical citations are represented as annotations as defined by the Open Annotation Data Model<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup> (see Fig. 3).</p>
<h3 id="figure-4-an-extracted-citation-represented-by-means-of-the-oac-ontology-and-serialized-as-rdfturtle.">Figure 4: An extracted citation represented by means of the OAC ontology and serialized as RDF/Turtle.</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;http://hellespont.org/annotations/jstor#16&gt; a oac:Annotation;

    oac:hasTarget &lt;http://jstor.org/stable/10.2307/268729&gt; .</code></pre>
<p>The string containing the citation is used as label for the annotation, whereas the citing and the cited texts become respectively its target and body–to use the OAC terminology–and are identified by the <code>oac:hasTarget</code> and <code>oac:hasBody</code> properties. The RDF fragment that is returned when the body URI is resolved (see Fig. 4) shows how the citation is not linked directly to the digital text but points to an intermediate object called <code>hucit:TextElement</code>. This abstract object identifies a citable element within the hierarchical structure of a text and is linked via the <code>hucit:resolves_to</code> property to digital representations of the cited passage, in this case the editions and translations available in the Perseus Digital Library<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>. Finally, the property <code>oac:motivatedBy</code> is used to explain the reason for creating the annotation, which in this case is to make explicit the object that is identified by a given citation.</p>
